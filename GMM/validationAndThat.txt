background foreground split:

whole point is to model the data using this.
Pixel by pixel basis is fine.

break into two sets of EMCentroids one purely on the background and one purely on the foreground.
choose based on who is most likely from each set.

hyper-parameters:
the number of centroids, number of features.

marking: make sure that comments, multiple files


validation 6 cross - need to have a partitioning along each time (K-fold partitioning LOOK UP):
choose two sets of numK
choose three sets of feature sets

do not forget fitting a different GM to has two sets of hyper-parameters (the background centeroid number and foreground centroid number)
